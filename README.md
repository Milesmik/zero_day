This is my first ubutu project on my personal computer
The program has been amazing thus far. I have learnt alot and it seems like the party is just started.
To name a few, I have been introduced to the following concepts
* 1 __VI__
* 2 __EMACS__
* 3 __GIT and GITHUB__
I have always liked the idea of using the Ubuntu operating system. Having to see this dream being actualize is so exiciting. I'm so loving every bit of this prorgamme.
I realy appreciate the organizers and I can wait to give back to the society and community in immeasurable ways.

__Gracias__ [^Te amo]
